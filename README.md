- I learned about the concept of "maximum margin" in machine learning models.
- I understood that larger margins help reduce generalization error, while smaller margins increase the risk of overfitting or underfitting.
- I became familiar with the concept of "slack variables," introduced by W. Vapnik in 1995, which make SVM models more flexible when data is not linearly separable.
- I learned that these variables are represented by the parameter \( C \), which controls error tolerance and the trade-off between bias and variance.
- I realized that adjusting the value of \( C \) is crucial for ensuring the model generalizes well to new data, avoiding overfitting and underfitting.

## Day 8: Aug 3, 2024

- Today I learned about decision tree learning.
- Tree-based models are a good choice when interpretability is crucial.
- Data is classified based on the questions the model asks.
- The process starts at the top of the tree, selecting the feature with the highest Information Gain (IG).
- This process is repeated until the branches are pure, meaning a class has been chosen.
- In practice, this process can easily lead to overfitting.
- The goal is to choose the feature that provides the highest possible gain in information.
- To achieve this, an objective function is defined and optimized using the Decision Tree algorithm.
- Mathematically, Information Gain is the difference between the impurity of the parent node and the sum of the impurities of the child nodes.
- The lower the impurity of the children, the higher the gain.
- Computationally, it can be impractical, so sklearn uses the binary decision tree algorithm.
- The impurity measures used by binary decision trees include: Gini impurity (IG), Entropy (IH), and Classification Error (IE).

## Day 9: Aug 4, 2024

- Random Forest is a technique that combines multiple decision trees.
- This model is considered an **ensemble** of decision trees.
- Random Forest averages the decision trees to generate a consistent result.
- The method helps to avoid overfitting.
- The technique consists of four main steps:
  1. Create a test set.
  2. Branch a decision tree for each test set and split the features at each node with the highest gain, based on the chosen metric.
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2.
  4. Aggregate the results and choose the winning class by majority vote.

## Day 10: Aug 6, 2024

- I learned that Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to generate more consistent results and avoid overfitting.
- I learned that the Random Forest process involves creating test sets, building a decision tree for each test set, repeating these steps, and finally aggregating the results through majority voting.
- I learned that reducing the sample size increases diversity and reduces the chances of overfitting, although it may negatively impact overall performance.
- I learned that K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a lazy-learning algorithm that memorizes training data instead of optimizing a function.
- I learned that KNN is a non-parametric and instance-based algorithm, which adapts easily to new data but requires more resources as the amount of data increases.
- I learned that KNN classifies data by identifying the nearest elements and choosing the class based on majority voting.

## Day 11: Aug 7, 2024

- In the real world, data can be presented in different ways, generally irregular, missing values ​​are one of the manifestations, they can occur for several reasons; forgetfulness, non-existence of information; typing errors. There are techniques to deal with the absence of this data, such as deleting or replacing the data.
- We can use `isnull().sum()` to verify all null values on a dataframe
- To remove null data from our dataframe we can you the method .drop(), the method has some parameters i.e 'all' that removes only rows where all values are null.

## Day 12: Aug 9, 2024

- **I learned** that deleting missing numeric values can lead to significant information loss.
- **I learned** about interpolation, a common technique for filling missing data by replacing null values with the column’s mean.
- **I learned** that scikit-learn provides tools to perform interpolation of missing values.
- **I learned** how to use the scikit-learn API:
  - `data.fit`: Used to learn the parameters from the data.
  - `data.transform`: Applies the learned transformation.
  - `data.predict`: A method used by estimators to make predictions on test data.
- **I learned** that data consistency is important, as the array used in `fit` must have the same number of features when it is transformed.
- Today I learned that nominal classes do not need to follow any specific order and can start counting from 0.
- Today I learned that assigning ordered numerical values to nominal categorical features can lead to incorrect assumptions in machine learning models.
- Today I learned that one-hot encoding is a technique to prevent models from assuming an ordinal relationship among nominal categories by creating a binary representation for each category.

## Day 13: Aug 12, 2024

- Today I learned the importance of partitioning a dataset into separate training and test datasets, which allows us to evaluate the model's performance before deploying it in the real world.
- I learned about the benefits of bringing features onto the same scale, as most machine learning models perform better when the data is scaled.
- I learned that normalization typically involves limiting the range of values, usually between [0, 1], and can be achieved using the `MinMaxScaler` in scikit-learn.
- I also learned that scaling adjusts the proportion of the data, but it does not normalize the data.

## Day 14: Aug 19, 2024

A **Regularização** é um método que pune **weights** grandes, desse modo, a complexidade do modelo é diminuída; evitando assim, overfitting.

## Day 15: Aug 20, 2024

**Sklearn** allows access to the values for **bias** and **weight** used by the model:

- intercept_ (bias)
- coef_ (weight)

The value of C and Regularization are closely connected in an inverse relationship: the smaller the value of C, the stronger the Regularization.

### Sequential feature selection algorithms

We can select features in two ways: extraction or selection. Selection involves choosing a few of the most relevant features from the dataset. On the other hand, extraction implies creating a new subset of features from the dataset.

When the function returns `self`, meaning the object itself, it indicates that we can apply a "chain of methods":
`obj.action1.action2...`.

## Day 16: Aug 23, 2024

- I read the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and learned that:
  - The Transformer architecture achieves better results in translation tasks than RNNs.
  - Transformers consume fewer resources to train compared to other sequential models.
